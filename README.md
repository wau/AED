* [Project 2: Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/wau/AED_P2/tree/6d83bcfaceda8c8240998b01c3b9090f4ce645cf) -> [[Task](https://github.com/wau/AED_P2/blob/6d83bcfaceda8c8240998b01c3b9090f4ce645cf/P2.pdf)] [[Source](https://github.com/wau/AED_P2/tree/6d83bcfaceda8c8240998b01c3b9090f4ce645cf/src/aed)]

   The first algorithm is called JumpBubbleSort but with some changes for more effeciency in some cases.\

   The second algorithm is caled QuickSort3Way, an improved version that is more efficient in general, but its really efficient dealing with arrays with a  lot of equal repeated elements.\

* [Project 3: Treap](https://github.com/wau/AED_P3/tree/ac5743b051fc9afdbfacf3aa1a75b0cfa68dae4a) -> [[Task](https://github.com/wau/AED_P3/blob/ac5743b051fc9afdbfacf3aa1a75b0cfa68dae4a/P3.pdf)] [[Source](https://github.com/wau/AED_P3/tree/ac5743b051fc9afdbfacf3aa1a75b0cfa68dae4a/src/aed/tables)]

   A mix between a Binary Tree and a Heap combining Key:Value pairs, randomness on an added object, and tree rotations making it a always a balanced tree,  and a very effecient data structure for the most of the operations.\

* [Project 4: MST Graph algorithms](https://github.com/wau/AED_P4/tree/cde85c9dccbd1dd10279585bfad281576b53d8cd) -> [[Task](https://github.com/wau/AED_P4/blob/cde85c9dccbd1dd10279585bfad281576b53d8cd/P4.pdf)] [[Source](https://github.com/wau/AED_P4/tree/cde85c9dccbd1dd10279585bfad281576b53d8cd/src/aed/graphs)]

   A minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm based on the cycles of the graph.\
